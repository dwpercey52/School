After running the program multiple times it successfully worked.
However I'm a little wary of the way I implemented the semaphores.
If at all possible maybe give good feedback or edit the code if you have the chance!
I would love to see a good "solution" to this program. I feel like I understand
generally about locks/semaphores but implementing them kind of confused me.
