Everything works just 2 slight hiccups.
Occasionally the server-peer connection messes up passing the last guy info. but just a simple rebooting server/clients fixes it.
On exitting the program (with option 4) in the program. For example we have 3 people and user 3 hits exit, it will perfectly move
the loop to just users 1-2 fine, but sometimes on the user that exits it hangs and doesn't fully "close". Once you exit a few clients you
will see. Most of them close down completely though. As mentioned though the ring operations work perfectly when exitting all the way down
to 1 user.
