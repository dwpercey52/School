I tried two different algorithms with the permute as it seem to make a huge difference on performance and outcome.
This one in the main file here uses a series of while loops. This seems to work for bigger numbers but gets a bigger spanning difference
I.E 120~160% optimal.

In the 2ndAlgo folder is the same code except the permute was the code similar to the one provided in the "project 3 assignment" sheet.
It has a problem though. No matter how many tours/generations etc I put it seems the outcome is always 100~101% range. This seems not right
Anything over 10+ cities for this code also takes extremely long time. (maybe my mutation function is too good!)

I would enjoy some feedback on possibly coming up with a better solution for the permutation function as I know it's the source of all problems.
