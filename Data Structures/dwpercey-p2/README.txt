Project 2

	I didn't quite get the simulation running how I wanted to thus I had to wrap up the project. I attempted
many different methods on processing the events but couldn't quite get the desired results. The program itself will
simulate as if customer are coming in for any number 1-20000 customers. However the results are usually not that great.
The priority queue and the math functions perform perfectly, this was definiately a problem with processing the events as
they arrive. A possible solution would be to use a total time variable (in which I tried) but updating it would be the 
key part.
